## Slurm Test server

Largely based on that provided by [Giovanni Torres](https://github.com/giovtorres/docker-centos7-slurm).

---------------


### Installation

All the steps below are covered in setup.sh which can be run by:

```bash
bash setup.sh
```  

However, they can also be run manually if an unexpected error arises:

```bash
# Changes to the original setup
git clone https://github.com/giovtorres/docker-centos7-slurm
cat docker-compose.yml > docker-centos7-slurm/docker-compose.yml


```  

In both cases, downloading the necessary information and all the steps executed will require a few minutes.
